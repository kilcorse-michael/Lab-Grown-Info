        Synthetic gem-quality diamond crystals were first produced by <br /> General Electric.
        The first gem-quality stones were always yellow to brown in color because of contamination
        with nitrogen. Inclusions were common and the GE diamonds had different fluorescence and phosphorescence
        properties compared to natural diamonds.
